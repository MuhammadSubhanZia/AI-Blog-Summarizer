# 🍽️ AI Blog Summarizer by Chef Subhan

Welcome to **AI Blog Summarizer**, where blogs turn into bite-sized dishes cooked by AI, served with love 💛. This isn't just a blog tool it's a fully themed, chef-style digital experience that transforms long blogs into **Main Course summaries and Side Dish translations**.

## 🌶️ What Cooked This Project?

This journey started in a moment of UI frustration (you know, the classic pangy coding mood 😅). While seasoning some components, I randomly thought:
**“Why not create a kitchen where blogs are cooked and served as summaries?”**

That one thought lit the stove.
And alhamdulillah **this delicious project came out of the oven** 🔥✨

It’s a perfect blend of:

* 🤖 AI integration with Gemini
* 🍛 Translations in Urdu and more
* 🔊 Voice synthesis for each summary
* 🧾 Downloadable chef-themed PDFs
* 📦 Personal Recipe Shelf with save/delete options
